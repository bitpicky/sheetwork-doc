# Do I need to list ALL the columns in my sheets config?

No! You don't have to. You can leave the columns part empty and **you only need to add a column if you need an operation like** [**type casting**](../usage/sheet-configuration/column-operations-and-advanced-controls.md#data-type-casting) **or**[ **renaming**](../usage/sheet-configuration/column-operations-and-advanced-controls.md#column-renaming) **to happen.**
